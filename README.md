### Personal Website written using React.js

I studied Computer Engineering at Trinity College Dublin. This meant that I did general engineering for my first two years of study.
Once I started to specialise in Computers, I learned a lot about low-level computer programming, taking modules in Computer Architecture (using assembly language) and Data Structures & Algorithms in C++ as well as modules like Computer Graphics.

However, I did not learn any front-end development while in college so, at the end of 2019 I started a fairly high-level online course on full stack development to fill in gaps in my knowledge as well as for a bit of fun! So, why not create a personal website for myself.
