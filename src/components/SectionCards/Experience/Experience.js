            LexisNexis Risk Solutions (LNRS) utilises Big Data to provide risk analysis tools for a broad range of sectors including
            Healthcare, Insurance and Governments. I work as a test engineer in the Insurance branch on the Product Delivery team in
            Dublin. The best part of my job is the people I work with. Even when a sprint is not going to plan and workload
            increases, morale is always high and in turn, stress is mitigated. As a test engineer I love writing and reviewing code
            for automated tests in order to "blur the lines" between developers and traditional QAs or manual testers. Soon, we hope 
            for the roles of software engineer and test engineer to become one where everyone writes feature code as well as test
            code. My responsibilities include the following - some of which are not standard for my level:
          </p>
          <ul id='experienceList' className='tl'>
            <li>Writing automated tests using Java and Cucumber BDD</li>
            <li>Ensuring quality through testing as well as Jira tickets</li>
            <li>Training in interns</li>
            <li>Designing online technical assessments for future candidates</li>
            <li>Reviewing CVs and carrying out interviews</li>
            <li>Driver for the testing of Dublin's 25+ clients for its main product - Mapview</li>
            <li>Writing automation code and have written an entire automation suite for one project from scratch</li>
            <li>

              detective, raising awareness of GDPR compliance and security threats at home or in work
            </li>

              Technology Intern - LexisNexis Risk Solutions

            Starting as an intern, I had never written code in Java nor had I learned about any software testing methodologies or
            even interned before but I was excited for the challenge ahead. My initial role as an intern was to assist with the 
            revival of a suite of automated tests that had not been touched for a year due to lack of resources to spend time on it. 
            After impressing in the first half of my internship, an opportunity came along. A senior test engineer (3 levels above 
            my current role) was leaving and I was asked to take her place on a small team working on an integration between two of 
            the UK and Ireland's major products with one based in Dublin and the other in the UK. Being thrown in the deep end was an
            invaluable experience and an opportunity that I will always be grateful for. During this time I learned and achieved
            the following:
          </p>
          <ul id='experienceList' className='tl'>
            <li>Worked on a large-scale project that is used by many of the world's leading insurance companies</li>
            <li>Worked on a project from the 1st day of implementation, finishing it off as a full-time employee</li>
            <li>Wrote entire automation suite for the above project</li>
            <li>Agile methodologies and Behavior-Driven Development</li>
            <li>Working with Developers and Business Analysts to define user stories in Behavior Driven Development syntax</li>

            Stanley Park holds a special place in my heart. I was lucky enough to coach in one of the most beautful settings in the world.
            Stanley Park Tennis was a microcosm of Vancouver - diverse, picturesque, fun and friendly. Coaching here was all about giving
            people an opportunity to improve or learn something new in the most enjoyable, inclusive way possible.

            Having trained with Leinster tennis from 12 to 18 years old, I was asked to join in with their under 18's squad to set
            the bar for how you should train. This was while I was doing a the Tennis Ireland Level 1 Coach course on weekends and so,
            allowed me to gain more experience as a coach.
